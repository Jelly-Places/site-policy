## Site Policy on Jelly Places

The universe of policies and procedures that govern the use of Jelly
Places, open-sourced for your use and inspiration. We created this
repository as a place for people to fork, contribute to, and provide
feedback on our policies. While this is our official repo of
open-sourced policies, it may not reflect the exact policies that are
live on Jelly Places because this site is updated separately from the
Help site.

#### How often will Jelly Places review these policies?

We have a semi-annual review and modification process for the policies
in this repository. This allows plenty of time for discussion and lets
our community rely on our policies. Of course, Jelly Places may alter
our policies outside that schedule if necessary, such as when we have
new product releases.

## The official legal disclaimer part:

- The information in this repository is for informational purposes only
  and is not intended to convey or constitute legal advice. It is not
  intended as a solicitation, and your use of this information does not
  create an attorney-client relationship between you and Jelly Places.
  Jelly Places is not a law firm. (You know that, though, right?)
- These policies and procedures may not suit your organization's needs.
  Please consult a lawyer if you want to adopt these policies for your
  own uses.
