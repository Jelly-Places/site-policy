##  Last Updated: January 14, 2020

####  Version: 1.0.0

JELLY PLACES is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy
Policy (this “**Policy**”) describes how JELLY PLACES may collect, use,
share, and keep information about you and what choices you have. This
Policy applies to JELLY PLACES' websites, progressive web apps, web
apps, native apps, desktop applications, or online offerings
(collectively, the “Platform”), and will be available by link on all
sites and offerings which it covers. You should review the applicable
privacy policy available.

JELLY PLACES reevaluates this Policy on an ongoing basis and reserves
the right to change its Policy at any time in its sole discretion. All
changes to the terms of this Policy shall be effective as of the date on
which they are posted on the Platform.

Your use of the Platform or offerings covered by this Policy constitutes
your consent to the practices described herein. Capitalized terms not
defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings set forth in the Terms
of Use (located at jellyplaces.com/terms-of-use). If you do not agree to
abide by this or any future Privacy Policy, do not use, access or
participate in (or continue to use, access or participate in) the
Platform. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the
latest information on our privacy practices.

JELLY PLACES collects information and data about you and, if applicable,
your companies in a continuous effort to improve your experience and to
communicate with you about its products, services, and promotions. JELLY
PLACES may collect such information as your name, e-mail and postal
addresses, credit card numbers, company information, descriptions of
properties, and other personally identifying information that you
provide to JELLY PLACES (hereinafter, collectively “Information”). JELLY
PLACES may, from time to time, append data from other sources to
supplement the Information you provide to enhance the information JELLY

You can update or delete your personal information on the Platform or by
sending an e-mail to
[help@jellyplaces.com](mailto:help@jellyplaces.com). If you wish to make
any such changes or deletions, you should be sure to include your
Platform e-mail address, full name, and password, if applicable.

JELLY PLACES is based in the United States, and the information we
collect is governed by U.S. law and the laws of the other countries in

publicly available tools, such as Google Analytics, to better understand

entities may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect

the popularity of certain content, and better understand user online
activity.

collection technologies on the Platform and in its newsletters and

parties. JELLY PLACES has no technical influence to avoid this. You have
the responsibility to protect the information you provide, especially
user name and passwords, from misuse, whether by encryption or other
means.
